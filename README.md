# Embedded systems

This repository contains the examples created in the Embedded systems practices. Each folder includes the source code for an ESP32 project written in the Arduino IDE. 

### Required steps before testing examples:

1. Install Arduino IDE:
[Click here](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide/)

2. Install Arduino-ESP32 support: 
[Click here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html#installing-using-arduino-ide)

3. Create separate folders for each example

### Recommended folder structure:

Python files

```bash
embed-examples-folder
├── example-1
│   ├── main.ino
│   ├── something.h
│   ├── something.cpp
│   └── ...
├── example-2
│   ├── main.ino
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

### If your old code is cached:

Change the verbosity level in the __Core Debug Level__ settings, this will force a clean.
